# Barcode Scanner

This Python script will allow you to enter/scan item barcodes to gather a list of bib/item details, via the Sierra APIs, without needing to have Sierra running on your device.

The data includes fields that are helpful for shelf reading, weeding and title curation purposes. The resulting table can then be exported as an Excel or CSV file.
